# MARZ_Analysis_Tools

R. Datta, Aug 15, 2024

This repo contains code for post-processing and analyzing data collected on the MARZ platform. 

Please download and unzip each sub-folder to access the code and instructions specific to a given diagnostic.

Experimental details are in:

[1] R. Datta et al. (2024) PRL. https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.132.155102 and
[2] R. Datta, et al. (2024). Phys. Plasmas. https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0201683

The diagnostics include:

# (1) Inductive / B-dot Probes

Data from each probe is stored as .CSV files.
We perfom common mode rejection to find the inductive signal, and integrate the signal(s) using known calibration factors to determine the magnetic field.

# (2) Visible Spectroscopy (SVS)

Data is stored in HDF files.

# (3) X Ray Spectroscopy (XRS3)

# (4) Ultra Fast Imaging (UXI) Pinhole Cameras

# (5) Self-Emission Gated Optical Imager (SEGOI)

# (6) X Ray Diodes (TADPoles and LOS 170 Silicon Diodes)

# (7) Current Diagnostics (IDTLs, PDV, and Machine B-dots)
